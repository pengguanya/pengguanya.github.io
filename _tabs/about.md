I am a data scientist and problem-solver with expertise in mathematics, statistics, programming, Linux/Unix, biomedical research, and drug development. My work blends advanced data science techniques, real-world clinical trials experience, and hands-on knowledge of computerized systems. I draw on a background in international medical device and pharmaceutical companies, where I learned to balance industry standards with innovative solutions to tackle complex challenges.

## Main Focus

My blog is organized into four core pillars that represent my professional focus:

* **Quantitative Research:** Deep dives into mathematics, statistics, and probabilistic modeling (e.g., Beta distributions, Bayesian inference).
* **Drug Development:** Insights into clinical trial protocols, safety reporting, and navigating regulatory landscapes (e.g., EU AI Act, Post-market investigation).
* **Intelligence & ML:** Exploring the frontiers of AI, Reinforcement Learning, and practical LLM integration.
* **DevOps & Computing:** Technical guides on Linux/Unix systems, cloud infrastructure (Azure), and automated development workflows.

Through these posts, I aim to bridge the gap between rigorous quantitative research and the practical, regulated requirements of the biomedical and clinical trial environments.
