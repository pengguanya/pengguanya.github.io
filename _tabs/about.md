I am a data scientist and problem-solver with expertise in mathematics, statistics, programming, Linux/Unix, biomedical research, and drug development. My work blends advanced data science techniques, real-world clinical trials experience, and hands-on knowledge of computerized systems. I draw on a background in international medical device and pharmaceutical companies, where I learned to balance industry standards with innovative solutions to tackle complex challenges.

## Main Focus

* Data Science, Statistics & Analytics
* Biomedical Research & Drug Development
* Clinical Trials & Regulatory Standards
* Technical topics including computerized systems, DevOps/MLOps & Linux/Unix OS

Through my blog posts, I aim to share insights and best practices that bridge cutting-edge quantitative research with the practical needs of biomedical and clinical trial environments.
