## Beta Distribution in Frequentist Inference

In my [previous post]({% post_url 2025-01-19-beta-distribution-part1 %}), I explored the basic properties of the Beta distribution and its role in Bayesian statistics. In this post, I shift focus to the **frequentist** perspective, examining how the Beta distribution appears in classical statistical methods like confidence interval construction, hypothesis testing and estimations.

This installment (Part 2.1) focuses on the **Clopper‚ÄìPearson confidence intervals** for proportions, a method that directly leverages the Beta distribution to ensure exact coverage. Beyond this specific application, my aim is to build a deeper intuition for the Beta distribution, enabling connections between different statistical concepts and better understanding the principles underpinning these methods.

## Confidence Intervals for Proportions (Clopper‚ÄìPearson)

When observing a binomial outcome, such as $$k$$ successes out of $$n$$ trials, the most straightforward estimate of the probability of success $$p$$ is the sample proportion $$\hat{p} = k / n$$. Constructing a confidence interval for $$p$$ can be done using various methods, including the **Wald interval**, **Wilson interval**, and others. Among these, the **Clopper‚ÄìPearson interval** is a classic ‚Äúexact‚Äù method that directly incorporates the Beta distribution.

Given observed data $$ (k, n) $$, the **Clopper‚ÄìPearson** $$ 100(1 - \alpha)\% $$ confidence interval for $$p$$ is defined as:

$$
\Bigl( p_{\text{lower}}, \, p_{\text{upper}} \Bigr),
$$

where:

$$
p_{\text{lower}} = 
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{if } k = 0, \\
B^{-1}\bigl(\tfrac{\alpha}{2};\, k,\; n-k+1\bigr), & \text{if } 0 < k < n,
\end{cases}
$$

$$
p_{\text{upper}} = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } k = n, \\
B^{-1}\bigl(1 - \tfrac{\alpha}{2};\, k+1,\; n-k\bigr), & \text{if } 0 < k < n.
\end{cases}
$$

Here, $$ B^{-1}(p; \alpha, \beta) $$ denotes the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the $$ \mathrm{Beta}(\alpha, \beta) $$ distribution, often implemented as `qbeta()` in statistical software.

The Clopper‚ÄìPearson interval guarantees exact coverage, meaning the true coverage probability is at least $$1 - \alpha$$ for every possible value of $$p$$. However, this guarantee often comes at the expense of conservatism, as these intervals can be wider than other methods such as the Wilson interval.

## Relationship to the Beta Distribution

### 1. Binomial Cumulative Probabilities

For a binomial random variable $$X \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p)$$, the probability of observing *up to* $$k$$ successes is:

$$
P(X \leq k) \;=\; \sum_{i=0}^{k} \binom{n}{i} p^i (1-p)^{n-i}.
$$

In the **Clopper‚ÄìPearson** method, the goal is to identify the range of $$p$$ values for which the observed outcome $$k$$ is not too surprising, based on a specified significance level $$\alpha$$. Specifically, the bounds $$p_{\text{lower}}$$ and $$p_{\text{upper}}$$ are determined such that the cumulative probabilities meet the thresholds $$\alpha/2$$ and $$1 - \alpha/2$$.

### 2. Constructing the Interval

To construct the confidence interval, we solve for $$p_{\text{lower}}$$ and $$p_{\text{upper}}$$ such that:

- $$p_{\text{lower}}$$ is the value where $$P(X \geq k)$$ equals $$\alpha/2$$.
- $$p_{\text{upper}}$$ is the value where $$P(X \leq k)$$ equals $$\alpha/2$$.

Intuitively, for $$p_{\text{lower}}$$, we want to find the smallest $$ p $$ where observing $$ k $$ or more successes would not be too rare. For $$p_{\text{upper}}$$, we seek the largest $$ p $$ where observing $$ k $$ or fewer successes would not be too rare.

Mathematically, we solve:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=k}^{n} \binom{n}{i} p_{\text{lower}}^i (1-p_{\text{lower}})^{n-i} &= \frac{\alpha}{2}, \\
    \sum_{i=0}^{k} \binom{n}{i} p_{\text{upper}}^i (1-p_{\text{upper}})^{n-i} &= \frac{\alpha}{2}.
\end{align*}
$$

By pinpointing the values of $$p$$ that satisfy the cumulative probability thresholds, we determine the exact boundaries of the confidence interval without relying on approximations.

### 3. From Binomial Sums to the Incomplete Beta Function

A key insight is that the cumulative sum of binomial probabilities is connected to Beta function through the regularized incomplete Beta function:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{k} \binom{n}{i} p^i (1-p)^{n-i} \;=\; 1 - I_p(k+1, n-k),
$$

where $$I_p(\alpha, \beta)$$ is the **regularized incomplete Beta function**, which is exactly the **CDF of the Beta distribution**:

$$
I_p(\alpha, \beta) \;=\; \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)} \int_0^p t^{\alpha-1} (1-t)^{\beta-1} \, dt,
$$

and $$B(\alpha, \beta)$$ is the Beta function:

$$
B(\alpha, \beta) = \int_0^1 t^{\alpha-1} (1-t)^{\beta-1} \, dt.
$$

By substituting this relationship into the cumulative binomial probability, we see that solving:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{k} \binom{n}{i} p_{\text{upper}}^i (1-p_{\text{upper}})^{n-i} = \frac{\alpha}{2}
$$

is equivalent to finding the value of $$p_{\text{upper}}$$ such that:

$$
I_{p_{\text{upper}}}(k+1, n-k) = 1 - \frac{\alpha}{2} 
$$

Therefore:

$$
p_{\text{upper}} = B^{-1}\left( 1 - \frac{\alpha}{2};\, k + 1,\, n - k \right)
$$

, where $$ B^{-1}(q; \alpha, \beta) $$ denotes the **quantile function** of the Beta distribution

Similarly, we can derive the expression for $$p_{\text{lower}}$$:

$$
p_{\text{lower}} = B^{-1}\left( \frac{\alpha}{2};\, k,\, n - k + 1 \right)
$$

Together, these bounds define the Clopper-Pearson confidence interval:

$$
\left[\, 
B^{-1}\left( \frac{\alpha}{2};\, k,\, n - k + 1 \right),\; 
B^{-1}\left( 1 - \frac{\alpha}{2};\, k + 1,\, n - k \right)\, 
\right]
$$

**Beta-Binomial Duality**

The above derivation reveals a striking duality: the cumulative probability of observing up to $$k$$ successes under a binomial model directly maps to the CDF of a Beta distribution. Specifically:
- The upper bound $$p_{\text{upper}}$$ is the $$(1 - \alpha/2)$$ quantile of a Beta($$k + 1, n - k$$) distribution.  
- The lower bound $$p_{\text{lower}}$$ is the $$\alpha/2$$ quantile of a Beta($$k, n - k + 1$$) distribution.

This duality connects discrete binomial trials to the continuous Beta distribution and ensures that the excluded tails (each with probabilities $$\leq \alpha/2$$) in both directions sum to $$\alpha$$, guaranteeing coverage $$\geq 1 - \alpha$$.

**A Hidden Symmetry**

The Beta distribution exhibits a fundamental symmetry through its CDF:
$$
I_p(a, b) + I_{1-p}(b, a) = 1,
$$
where $$I_p(a, b)$$ is the probability that a $$ \text{Beta}(a, b) $$ random variable is $$ \le p$$. This symmetry ensures the interval adapts to both successes ($$k$$) and failures ($$n - k$$). For example, if successes are rare (small $$k$$), the interval shifts left to account for uncertainty, and vice versa. The symmetry reflects the inherent balance of the Beta distribution and its ability to model complementary probabilities.

> **üí°NOTE:**
> Why does such duality exist? And why do the Beta parameters shift between bounds‚Äîfor example, from $$(k, n-k+1)$$ for the lower bound to $$(k+1, n-k)$$ for the upper bound? This intriguing shift hints at a deeper mathematical structure underlying the binomial phenomenon, which I may explore in future posts.

## Simulations: Coverage and Interval Width

To illustrate the behavior of the Clopper‚ÄìPearson interval, I conducted a simulation in R. Here‚Äôs the approach:

1. Simulate $$k \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p_{\text{true}})$$ over multiple runs.
2. Compute intervals using:
   - **Clopper‚ÄìPearson (Exact)**: Obtained using `binom.confint(..., method = "exact")`.
   - **Wald (Naive)**: Calculated as $$\hat{p} \pm z \sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n}$$.
3. Evaluate each method‚Äôs coverage (percentage of intervals containing $$p_{\text{true}}$$) and interval width.

### Results

- **Coverage:** Clopper‚ÄìPearson achieves the nominal 95% coverage, while Wald often falls below this threshold.
  ```
  Coverage (Clopper‚ÄìPearson): 0.957 
  Coverage (Wald):            0.939
  ```
- **Interval Width:** Clopper‚ÄìPearson intervals are wider than Wald intervals, reflecting the trade-off between exact coverage and narrower intervals.

In a second simulation, I examined coverage across different sample sizes. As shown, Clopper‚ÄìPearson maintains its exact coverage ($$ \ge 95\% $$) even for small sample sizes, whereas Wald intervals can dip below the nominal level.

## Summary

The Clopper‚ÄìPearson interval, rooted in the Beta distribution, demonstrates the power of exact statistical methods. While its intervals may be conservative, the guarantee of coverage makes it a reliable choice, especially for small sample sizes or extreme proportions. This exploration reinforces how the Beta distribution serves as a **bridge between discrete and continuous probability frameworks**, providing a deeper appreciation for its versatility in frequentist contexts.
